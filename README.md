# Equipable Vampire Claws - GC Version
My version of Equipable Vampire Claws - Player Version by AdoresUnicorns123 on NexusMods
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108475

## Requirements
Requires either Equipable Vampire Claws - Player Version or Vampires have Claws for textures. ESP of required mod can be disabled. Also requires SkyUI and RaceMenu.

## What's Different from original mod.
* Uses slot 61 for the claws -- full first person race compatibility. No need for separate patches.
* RaceMenu slider - Vampire Claws under the Body section.
* Only equipable via RaceMenu. No crafting, no claws in inventory.
* Load Order -- as long as it is after RaceMenu, it doesn't matter where goes. 
* MCM -- provides an option to have the claws unequip when wearing gloves or gauntlets.
* Fixed broken texture paths in meshes.
